## Overview
HW4 shows 3 functionality 
(Run source file on STM; *ble_scan_HW4.py* on raspberry pi):
* Enter '1' or '0' on raspberry pi to control STM's LED2. (Use raspberry pi as central, STM32L4 IoT node as BLE peripheral.)
* Test STM's notification function
* A service in STM32L4 IoT node so that it can send my student ID to raspberry pi through BLE
